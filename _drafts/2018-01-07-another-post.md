# Welcome

This is just a test to show if I can make this work

## Introduction

And this is how it all started

- nothing to hide
- nothing to report

it all **works**

You can add images:
![construction](/images/construction.jpg)

and even code!

{% highlight xml %}
<config>
    <asdf>hello</asdf>
</config>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight csharp %}
public class Test
{
    public Test() {}
    public void DoesNothing()
    {
        var i = 0;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
